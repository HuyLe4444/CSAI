        Pacman's current position (e.g., for DirectionalGhost).  However, this
        is not a problem, as Pacman's current position is known.

        In order to obtain the distribution over new positions for the ghost,
        given its previous position (oldPos) as well as Pacman's current
        position, use this line of code:

        multiple position distributions for a single update.

        newPostDist[p] = Pr( ghost is at position p at time t + 1 | ghost is at position oldPos at time t )

        As an implementation detail (with which you need not concern yourself),
        the line of code at the top of this comment block for obtaining
        newPosDist makes use of two helper methods provided in InferenceModule
        above:

          1) self.setGhostPosition(gameState, ghostPosition)
              This method alters the gameState by placing the ghost we're
              tracking in a particular position.  This altered gameState can be
              used to query what the ghost would do in this position.

          2) self.getPositionDistribution(gameState)
              This method uses the ghost agent to determine what positions the
              ghost will move to from the provided gameState.  The ghost must be
              placed in the gameState with a call to self.setGhostPosition
              above.

        It is worthwhile, however, to understand why these two helper methods
        are used and how they combine to give us a belief distribution over new
        positions after a time update from a particular position.

        To loop over the ghosts, use:

          for i in range(self.numGhosts):
            ...

        Then, assuming that `i` refers to the index of the ghost, to obtain the
        distributions over new positions for that single ghost, given the list
        (prevGhostPositions) of previous positions of ALL of the ghosts, use
        this line of code:

          newPosDist = getPositionDistributionForGhost(
             setGhostPositions(gameState, prevGhostPositions), i, self.ghostAgents[i]
          )

        Note that you may need to replace `prevGhostPositions` with the correct
        name of the variable that you have used to refer to the list of the
        previous positions of all of the ghosts, and you may need to replace `i`
        with the variable you have used to refer to the index of the ghost for
        which you are computing the new position distribution.

        As an implementation detail (with which you need not concern yourself),
        the line of code above for obtaining newPosDist makes use of two helper
        functions defined below in this file:

          1) setGhostPositions(gameState, ghostPositions)
              This method alters the gameState by placing the ghosts in the
              supplied positions.

          2) getPositionDistributionForGhost(gameState, ghostIndex, agent)
              This method uses the supplied ghost agent to determine what
              positions a ghost (ghostIndex) controlled by a particular agent
              (ghostAgent) will move to in the supplied gameState.  All ghosts
              must first be placed in the gameState using setGhostPositions
              above.

              The ghost agent you are meant to supply is
              self.ghostAgents[ghostIndex-1], but in this project all ghost
              agents are always the same.
